**Weakly Supervised Learning for Industrial Optical Inspection** is a dataset for an instance segmentation task. It is used in the industrial domain. 



The dataset consists of 16100 images with 2120 labeled objects belonging to 1 single class (*defect*).

Images in the Industrial Optical Inspection dataset have pixel-level instance segmentation annotations. Due to the nature of the instance segmentation task, it can be automatically transformed into a semantic segmentation (only one mask for every class) or object detection (bounding boxes for every object) tasks. There are 14000 (87% of the total) unlabeled images (i.e. without annotations). There are 10 splits in the dataset: *Class1* (1150 images), *Class2* (1150 images), *Class7* (2300 images), *Class3* (1150 images), *Class5* (1150 images), *Class8* (2300 images), *Class10* (2300 images), *Class6* (1150 images), *Class4* (1150 images), and *Class9* (2300 images). The dataset was released in 2007.

Here is the visualized example grid with annotations:
